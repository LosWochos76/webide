# webide

WebIDE is a simple browser-based environment to write, compile and interactively execute C/C++ programs. It is based on [node.js](https://nodejs.org), [xterm.js](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/) and the [Ace code editor](https://ace.c9.io). 

Be careful: Do not expose the service to the public as is due to security issues. The whole environment is made to be hosted inside of a docker-image.

## Howto install and run

- Step 1: clone the repository.
- Step 2: npm install.
- Step 3: node app.js
