# webide

WebIDE is a simple browser-based environment to write, compile and interactively execute C/C++ programs. It is bases on node.js, xterm.js and the Ace code editor. Be careful: Do not expose the service to the public as is due to security issues. It is made to be hosted inside of a docker-image.
